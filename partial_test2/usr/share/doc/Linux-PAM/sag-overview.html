      For the uninitiated, we begin by considering an example.  We take an
      application that grants some service to users;
      <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span> is one such program.
      <span class="command"><strong>Login</strong></span> does two things, it first establishes that
      the requesting user is whom they claim to be and second provides
      them with the requested service: in the case of
      <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span> the service is a command shell
      (bash, tcsh, zsh, etc.) running with the identity of the user.
    </p><p>
      Traditionally, the former step is achieved by the
      <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span> application prompting the user for a
      password and then verifying that it agrees with that located on
      the system; hence verifying that as far as the system is concerned
      the user is who they claim to be. This is the task that is delegated
      to <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux-PAM</em></span>.
    </p><p>
      From the perspective of the application programmer (in this case
      the person that wrote the <span class="command"><strong>login</strong></span> application),
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux-PAM</em></span> takes care of this
      authentication task -- verifying the identity of the user.
    </p><p>
      The flexibility of <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux-PAM</em></span> is
      that <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>, the system administrator, have
      the freedom to stipulate which authentication scheme is to be
      used. You have the freedom to set the scheme for any/all
      PAM-aware applications on your Linux system. That is, you can
      authenticate from anything as naive as
      <span class="emphasis"><em>simple trust</em></span> (<span class="command"><strong>pam_permit</strong></span>)
      to something as paranoid as a combination of a retinal scan, a
      voice print and a one-time password!
    </p><p>
      To illustrate the flexibility you face, consider the following
      situation: a system administrator (parent) wishes to improve the
      mathematical ability of her users (children). She can configure
      their favorite ``Shoot 'em up game'' (PAM-aware of course) to
      authenticate them with a request for the product of a couple of
      random numbers less than 12. It is clear that if the game is any
      good they will soon learn their
      <span class="emphasis"><em>multiplication tables</em></span>. As they mature, the
      authentication can be upgraded to include (long) division!
    </p><p>
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux-PAM</em></span> deals with four
      separate types of (management) task. These are:
      <span class="emphasis"><em>authentication management</em></span>;
      <span class="emphasis"><em>account management</em></span>;
      <span class="emphasis"><em>session management</em></span>; and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>password management</em></span>.
      The association of the preferred management scheme with the behavior
      of an application is made with entries in the relevant
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux-PAM</em></span> configuration file.
      The management functions are performed by <span class="emphasis"><em>modules</em></span>
      specified in the configuration file. The syntax for this
      file is discussed in the section
      <a class="link" href="sag-configuration.html" title="Chapter 4. The Linux-PAM configuration file">below</a>.
    </p><p>
      Here is a figure that describes the overall organization of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux-PAM</em></span>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">

                         +--------------+
                         |   session    |--[ e ]--[ c ]
                         +--------------+
      </pre><p>
      By way of explanation, the left of the figure represents the
      application; application X.  Such an application interfaces with the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux-PAM</em></span> library and knows none of
      the specifics of its configured authentication method. The
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux-PAM</em></span> library (in the center)
      consults the contents of the PAM configuration file and loads the
      modules that are appropriate for application-X. These modules fall
      into one of four management groups (lower-center) and are stacked in
      the order they appear in the configuration file. These modules, when
      called by <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux-PAM</em></span>, perform the
      various authentication tasks for the application. Textual information,
      required from/or offered to the user, can be exchanged through the
      use of the application-supplied <span class="emphasis"><em>conversation</em></span>
      function.
    </p><p>
      If a program is going to use PAM, then it has to have PAM
      functions explicitly coded into the program. If you have
      access to the source code you can add the appropriate PAM
      functions. If you do not have access to the source code, and
      the binary does not have the PAM functions included, then
      it is not possible to use PAM.
