/*
 * Drivers overview
 * ================
 *
 * In syslog-ng nomenclature a driver is either responsible for handling
 * incoming messages (also known as source driver), or to send them out to
 * another party (also known as the destination driver).  Source drivers are
 * created in "source" statements and destination drivers are similarly
 * created in "destination" statements.
 *
 * Drivers are derived from LogPipes, in essence they use the same "queue"
 * method to forward messages further down the processing pipeline.
 *
 * Driver plugins
 * ==============
 *
 * It is possible to change the behaviour of a driver somewhat by adding
 * "plugins" to drivers.  These plugins basically get a chance to override
 * LogDriver virtual methods, change their semantics and possibly rely on
 * the original behaviour too.  This way, functionalities that are present
 * in all destination drivers can easily shared, without having to recode
 * the same stuff multiple times.
 *
 * Driver plugins are activated with the "attach" virtual method, which in
 * turn may redirect any of the LogDriver virtual methods to themselves.
 * They can even have a "user_data" pointer, so that they can locate their
 * associated state.
 *
 * Multiple plugins can hook into the same method, by saving the original
 * address & original user_data value.
 *
